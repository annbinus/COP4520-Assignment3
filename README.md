# Problem 1: The Birthday Presents Party

## Running the Code:

To run the code, you first need to clone the repository to your local machine. Here are the general steps to do so:

1. Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, use the git clone command followed by the repository URL. For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/annbinus/COP4520-Assignment3.git
```

2. Navigate to the Directory:

After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory containing the code files using the cd command:

3. Compile and Run the Code:

Once inside the repository directory, you can compile and run the code files using the appropriate commands. For C++ code, you typically compile using a compiler like g++ and then execute the compiled binary.

```
g++ -o Problem1 Problem1.cpp
./Problem1

```
